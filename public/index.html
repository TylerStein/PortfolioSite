                        Bot-E Builder was created within 72 hours for the <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare Game Jam</a> under the theme of "Start with nothing". 
                        Our talented group worked dilligently to put together the ambitious idea of a game where you build up abilities by stealing them from other robots.
                        It was a welcome challenge to coordinate building a tight game with a large group and distributed tasks, and ultimately a lot of fun.
                        The game has a stable web release available here, the files for which can be found on my GitHub.

                        Geo Twist was created within 48 hours for the 2019 <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019">GTMK Game Jam</a> under the theme of "Only One". As a group of three collectively going in to our second jam,
                        we had an idea of how to tackle the game quickly without getting caught on prototyping dead ends. A few hours of brainstorming and paper-prototyping some ideas led to this game, a test of reflexes and ability ot navigate
                        levels with unorthodox controls. Much of the jam time was spent implementing visuals and building out levels. The game has a stable web release available here, the files for which can be found on my GitHub.

                        As a group of four, and a first jam for most of us, it was a great learning experience and a lot of fun all around.
                        The game has since had its code cleaned up and assets optomized for a stable web release, the files for which can be found on my GitHub.
