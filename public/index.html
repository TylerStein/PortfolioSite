                        Core Bore Was created within 48 hours for the 2020 <a href="https://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> under the theme of "Repair".
                        Our core development team consisted of 6 people, most of us having participated in previous jams. After a difficult start trying to nail down a jam-ready concept,
                        everyone found their roles in production and pulled through as a team to create this game. To me, there was a valuable lesson in seeing the increase in overhead
                        resulting from working in a large team. While it gives time for care to be put in to specific parts, organizing how all those pieces fit together 
                        becomes an exponentially more difficult task, especially between varying skill levels.

                        Bot-E Builder was created within 72 hours for the <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare Game Jam</a> under the theme of "Start with nothing". 
                        Our talented group worked dilligently to put together the ambitious idea of a game where you build up abilities by stealing them from other robots.
                        It was a welcome challenge to coordinate building a tight game with a large group and distributed tasks, and ultimately a lot of fun.
                        The game has a stable web release available here, the files for which can be found on my GitHub.

                        Geo Twist was created within 48 hours for the 2019 <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019">GTMK Game Jam</a> under the theme of "Only One". As a group of three collectively going in to our second jam,
                        we had an idea of how to tackle the game quickly without getting caught on prototyping dead ends. A few hours of brainstorming and paper-prototyping some ideas led to this game, a test of reflexes and ability ot navigate
                        levels with unorthodox controls. Much of the jam time was spent implementing visuals and building out levels. The game has a stable web release available here, the files for which can be found on my GitHub.
